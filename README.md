# Dijkstra-s-shortest-path-algorithm
Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm is used to determine the best possible/least cost associated path in a randomly generated connected graph.
The Dijkstra's algorithm is a well known method in graph theory and analysis.It is used to find the best possible path in a connected graph.
Over here i have implemented this algorithm using c++.
The concept of ADT, priority queues implemention using min heap, class and Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm are the critical concepts utilized to implement this code.
The code contains comments at relevent lines to have a clear understanding of the algorithm implementaion.
